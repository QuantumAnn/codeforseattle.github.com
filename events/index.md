Upgrade Seattle–a grassroots group of community organizers, artists, tech workers, and others–is calling for a city-owned alternative to the for-profit internet providers in the Puget Sound. Christopher Mitchell, Director of the Community Broadband Networks Initiative with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, local activist/musician Hollis Wong-Wear, and other community members will lead a discussion on the current push for city-owned internet and its broader implications for the community. The discussion will be followed by breakout sessions where attendees can get involved in organizing for better broadband.
